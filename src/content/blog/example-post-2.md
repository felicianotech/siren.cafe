Blah blah blah, hey. Here's a pull quote:

As per usual, I just want to remind everyone that you can download the Ubuntu 18.04 ISOs via torrent. This allows you to reduce the strain on Canonicalâ€™s (and their mirror) servers while possibly being a faster download as well.

Here are the torrents for both the desktop and server release:

- [Ubuntu 18.04 Desktop (64-bit)][1] 
- [Ubuntu 18.04 Server (64-bit)][2]
