Welcome to Siren Café! This is a post introducing Siren Café, myself, and why I created this blog.

<!--more-->

As the tagline says, Siren Café is a blog for Starbucks and Coffee lovers.
We'll be publishing articles that you might expect from Starbucks itself such as announcements on new drinks, food, merchandise, store openings, etc.
We'll cover Starbucks from a business and management perspective:

- What makes their brand so attractive to customers?
- What do they do different from competitors?

There will be posts bringing spotlight to Starbucks employees (who they affectionately call "partners") as well as customers of Starbucks.
Why cover customers of Starbucks?
Like bars and barbershops, coffee shops tend to become a place for community in a town or neighborhood.
They're a place to discuss politics, a place where an interview process can start, a place to meet a wedding planner, and an office for freelancers.
With the numerous reasons to be at a coffee shop and the variety of talented people who shop there, we believe that there's many untold stories to be shared.

## Who am I?

My name is Ricardo N Feliciano.
I am a U.S. Navy Veteran and a Developer Advocate at CircleCI.
In both my civilian and military careers, I've had the privilege to travel around the United States (and sometimes outside of it).
As a Starbucks fanatic, I visit a Starbucks everywhere I go.
I've seen Starbucks with creepy dolls in Texas, Starbucks that sell beer with a pub-like chalk sign on the sidewalk outside, a Starbucks that's drive-thru only in Coney Island, to the awe-inspiring Starbucks Reserve Roastery in Seattle.

## Why Create This Blog?

Starbucks is a huge company and already has their own blog called [Starbucks Channel][sb-blog].
So why am I creating my own? — Perspective.

As much as I might like Starbucks, they're not perfect.
No one is.
The post they share and the things they say will no doubt be influenced by their bottom line, marketing campaign direction, etc.
They are understandably biased.
They also see things as a business, as the service provider and not the customer.

Siren Café exists to share coffee and Starbucks stories and information from the perspective of the customer.
You'll learn a bit, save some money, and discover interesting things.
