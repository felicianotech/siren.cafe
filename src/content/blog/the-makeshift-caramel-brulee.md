The Starbucks [Caramel Brulée][caramel-brulee] is one of my favorite drinks.
I order it as a hot latte, which is warm, sweet and pairs beautifully with a classic coffee cake.
Great way to start my morning.
The problem? The caramel brulée is a season drink.

They introduce it in December and it sticks around to January, while supplies last.
Several years ago I learned how you can order a custom, or "makeshift" caramel brulée year-round at Starbucks.
Here's how.

<!--more-->

The "Makeshift" Caramel Brulée can be created by combining caramel (duh), toffee nut, and white chocolate.
For a latte, this creates a drink *very* similar to the original though slightly thicker and sweeter.
Over time, I've started to prefer the consistency of the makeshift version over the original.

## How To Order

I typically order this drink as a hot latte.
This is how you would order a grande:

- "May I have a
  - grande hot latte,
  - with two pumps caramel,
  - two pumps toffee nut,
  - and two pumps white mocha"

Again, I like my drinks somewhat sweet and I've heard from some that this drink is sweet.
If that's an issue for you, I'd suggest asking for 1 and ½ pumps instead.

Enjoy!
